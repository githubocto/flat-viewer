Flat Viewer is a tool to view un-nested data (CSV & JSON files) in an interactive table. The table has various affordances for exploring the data, such as:

- filtering
- sorting
- sticky header and column
- diffs for specific commits that change the data

## What is Flat Data? 

Flat Viewer is part of a larger project to make it easy to fetch and commit data into GitHub repositories. The action is intended to be run on a schedule, retrieving data from any supported target and creating a commit if there is any change to the fetched data. Flat Data builds on the [“git scraping” approach pioneered by Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/) to offer a simple pattern for bringing working datasets into your repositories and versioning them, because developing against local datasets is faster and easier than working with data over the wire.

## Usage
